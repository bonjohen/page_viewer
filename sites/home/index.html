      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        This is my personal projects hub—a collection of explorations, experiments, and documentation 
        across software engineering, martial arts training, and maker projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in continuous learning, building capabilities, and sharing the journey, but this 
        will be the first time I documented it in code as I developed it.
        This site serves as both a portfolio and a living notebook of things I'm working on, 
        learning about, and building. Started on November 24, 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the sidebar to explore different areas:
      </p>
      <ul class="intro-list">
        <li><strong>Software Engineering</strong> - AI systems, database architecture, and technical explorations</li>
        <li><strong>Martial Arts & Fitness</strong> - Solo training logs, drills, and technique development</li>
        <li><strong>Making Anything</strong> - Physical projects using 3D printing, CNC, electronics, and more</li>
        <li><strong>More To Come</strong> - Working on a music project and a few AI business ideas</li>
      </ul>

          <h3>Authentication System Planning - Phase 1: AWS Implementation</h3>
          <span class="log-date">2025-11-25</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Completed comprehensive design and planning for a modular authentication system with email/password
          login, email confirmation, and password reset flows. The implementation follows a phased approach:
        </p>
        <ul class="changelog-list">
          <li><strong>Phase 1 (Primary)</strong>: AWS-based email/password authentication using DynamoDB, Lambda,
              API Gateway, and SES, $5-15/month infrastructure cost</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 2 (Future)</strong>: Social login integration (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 3 (Future)</strong>: Additional backend implementations (Azure, Google Cloud, Supabase,
              Back4App)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Created detailed design document covering REST API specification, DynamoDB schema design, Lambda function
          organization, security controls (rate limiting, JWT management, password hashing), and AWS deployment
          architecture. Developed comprehensive implementation plan with 10 milestones, detailed task breakdowns,
          risk mitigation strategies, and success criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The modular architecture separates common components (authentication logic, validation, email service)
          from backend-specific components (storage layer, infrastructure), enabling code reuse across future
          implementations while delivering immediate value with the AWS implementation.
