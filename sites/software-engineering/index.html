          <div class="detail-block">
            <h4>What It Is</h4>
            <p>
              Database engineering is the craft of deciding how data lives: how it's modeled, stored, indexed, and accessed.
              It's about designing schemas, tuning queries, aligning OLTP and analytics needs, and ensuring systems stay fast
              and reliable even as data grows.
            </p>

            <h4>Why It's Valuable</h4>
            <p>
              If a system is a city, the database is the infrastructure under the streets. Good database engineering reduces
              latency, improves reliability, avoids outages, and creates a solid foundation for analytics, pipelines, and AI.
            </p>

            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>
              I started my software career in databases and never left. I've handled:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Schema and model design for business-critical systems.</li>
              <li>Performance tuning, lock analysis, and query optimization.</li>
              <li>Migrations and refactors under real traffic constraints.</li>
              <li>High-reliability systems where correctness and uptime matter most.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
              Everything else I do in the data stack builds on this foundation.

          <h3>Data Engineering</h3>
          <p>Building robust data pipelines</p>

          <div class="detail-block">
            <h4>What It Is</h4>
            <p>
              Data engineering builds the ingestion, transformation, and delivery pipelines that move data through an organization.
              It includes ETL/ELT, batch and streaming flows, orchestration, and structured data layers.
            </p>

            <h4>Why It's Valuable</h4>
            <p>
              Without dependable pipelines, analysts, ML engineers, and AI systems waste time fixing broken data rather than using it.
              Data engineering makes information usable, consistent, and timely.
            </p>

            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>I have built:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ETL/ELT pipelines powering analytics and ML systems.</li>
              <li>Large data migrations with safe cutovers and backfills.</li>
              <li>Operational pipelines balancing latency, cost, and correctness.</li>
              <li>Lineage frameworks tracking data from source to model.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
              I think in terms of lineage and impact: where data came from, how it changed, who depends on it, and what happens when it breaks.
            </p>

        <!-- DATA MANAGEMENT -->
        <div class="focus-card clickable-card" data-site-id="data-management">
          <h3>Data Management</h3>
          <p>Governance, security, and lifecycle</p>

          <div class="detail-block">
            <h4>What It Is</h4>
            <p>
              Data management treats data as an asset with responsibilities: governance, security, compliance, retention,
              archival, and deletion. It ensures data is accessed appropriately and handled legally.
            </p>

            <h4>Why It's Valuable</h4>
            <p>
              Regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, COPPA, and GDPR mean mishandling data isn't just sloppy—it's risky and expensive.
              Governance builds trust, protects users, and prevents legal exposure.
            </p>

            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>I've worked extensively with controlled data environments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Retention, archival, and secure deletion frameworks.</li>
              <li>Access control and privacy boundaries.</li>
              <li>Designing systems that remain safe, auditable, and compliant.</li>
              <li>HIPAA, GLBA, COPPA, and GDPR alignment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
              Data is our most valuable commodity, and it must be treated with care.

        <!-- AI ENGINEERING -->
        <div class="focus-card clickable-card" data-site-id="ai-engineering-journey">
          <h3>AI Engineering Journey</h3>
          <p>Agentic AI architectures and experiments</p>

          <div class="detail-block">
            <h4>What It Is</h4>
            <p>
              AI engineering, especially agentic AI, is about turning large language models into working collaborators:
              software that can reason over data, call tools, orchestrate workflows, and close the loop on real tasks.
              It's the intersection of data engineering, software design, and human-centered systems.
            </p>

            <h4>Why It's Valuable</h4>
            <p>
              Most organizations don't need “a chatbot”; they need AI that can read their documents, call their APIs,
              respect their permissions, and produce traceable answers. Agentic AI systems do this by chaining together
              models, tools, and data stores. Done well, they reduce busywork, surface insights faster, and create a layer
              of “intelligent glue” over existing systems.
            </p>

            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>
              I come to AI from the data side. I've spent decades building databases, ETL pipelines, data quality checks,
              and governed data environments at companies like Boeing, Microsoft, Getty Images, Demand Media, Virtuoso,
              and Google. Now I'm building:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>RAG pipelines that index documents, logs, and structured data so AI can answer questions with citations.</li>
              <li>Agentic workflows that use tools (web search, vector stores, SQL, file storage) to research, summarize, and act.</li>
              <li>Evaluation and observability patterns treating LLMs like components in a production system, not toys.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
              I reuse everything I know about schema design, lineage, quality, and governance—and apply it to systems where a
              “query plan” is now a chain of AI calls.
            </p>

        </div>
        <!-- DATA QUALITY -->
        <div class="focus-card clickable-card" data-site-id="data-quality">
          <h3>Data Quality</h3>
          <p>Accuracy, completeness, and reliability</p>

          <div class="detail-block">
            <h4>What It Is</h4>
            <p>
              Data quality is the discipline of making sure the data tells the truth—or at least, a consistent and well-understood
              version of it. It covers validation, deduplication, anomaly detection, reconciliation between systems, and ongoing monitoring.
            </p>

            <h4>Why It's Valuable</h4>
            <p>
              Every downstream function—analytics, operations, AI, compliance—depends on trusting the data. If the numbers are wrong or
              inconsistent, the best model, dashboard, or agent is just confidently wrong.
              Quality engineering ensures errors are caught early, root causes are identified, and impacts are understood.
            </p>

            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>For most of my career, “something looks wrong” has landed on my desk:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Detecting and fixing broken pipelines.</li>
              <li>Identifying missing joins and off-by-one logic.</li>
              <li>Diagnosing mismatched time zones and schema drift.</li>
              <li>Creating checks and alerts to catch issues before executives see them.</li>
              <li>Resolving source-of-truth conflicts across systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
              In agentic AI systems, data quality is even more critical: if you index the wrong data or index it incorrectly,
              the AI will confidently present garbage. My instinct is always to ask:
              <em>“Is this data actually correct, and how do we know?”</em>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- DATA PRESENTATION -->
        <div class="focus-card clickable-card" data-site-id="data-presentation">
          <h3>Data Presentation</h3>
          <p>Visualization and communication</p>

          <div class="detail-block">
            <h4>What It Is</h4>
            <p>
              Data presentation turns raw numbers into meaning: dashboards, visualizations, summaries, and narratives that drive
              understanding and decisions.
            </p>

            <h4>Why It's Valuable</h4>
            <p>
              Even the best datasets are useless if no one understands them. Good presentation bridges the gap between data and decision,
              tailoring insights to stakeholders.
            </p>

            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>
              I've built executive dashboards, analytical reports, and operational monitoring systems. I focus on clarity, accuracy,
              and narrative framing so people can act decisively and confidently.
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Without a good data presentation layer, all the data in the world is just noise.

      <h3>How It All Fits Together</h3>
      <p>
        Across all of these roles—database engineering, data engineering, data management,
        data presentation, and data quality—the theme is simple:
      </p>
      <p><strong>I do data. End to end.</strong></p>
      <p>
        From schema design and ETL to governance, visual storytelling, and now agentic AI,
        my work has always been about making information trustworthy, understandable, and
        usable in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Projects Hub is my way of breaking that long arc into clear paths, so you can explore
        whichever slice is most relevant—whether you're a hiring manager, a fellow engineer,
        or someone trying to understand how data and AI can actually help your organization, I hope this is valuable.
